## Features
- Easily change an app icon that doesn't fit in
- Create custom shortcuts to websites
- Hide apps you don't want to see
- Change properties in .desktop files
- GTK4 & libadwaita

## Known issues
Due to the limitations of the Flatpak sandbox, not all .desktop files are visible by default. It is still possible to open the files individually.
This could be solved by using a different packaging format, and contributions are welcome.

The app has ben rewritten, and some translations are no longer complete. Any help with that is greatly appreciated.
